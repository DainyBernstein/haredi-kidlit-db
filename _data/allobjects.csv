Both of them were successful and an order was passed to burn all volumes of the Talmud throughout Italy.

Will the Jews of Ita!y rescue their beloved seforim? And who is ""Sammy Slick,"" the mysterious Gypsy boy who befriends our heroes? Why is he helping them? What does he really want?

This book was written specially to introduce very young children aged 1 to 3 to the world of emotions. The text describes events and names emotions using familiar words, while the adorable full-color illustrations show appropriate facial expressions. The child learns that cause and effect exist in the world of emotions too, which makes that world more understandable to them. Straight from Tammy's Heart addresses the experience that concerns this age group most: attachment and separation. This is the age when children acquire their basic sense of trust and security through their relationship with their mother. Repeated experiences of closeness to an available and relaxed mother who is attentive to the child's needs develop in the child the feeling that the world is a good place and that the adults in it can be trusted. When a mother leaves her young child, he loses his anchor and can feel insecure. The book allows toddlers to process the experiences of separation from mother and more, to internalize the message that ""soon mother will return."""" -- back cover.",Emotions;Board books;Fiction,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,item

Eyal easily identified their commander by his age and the reverence that the young soldiers accorded him. As soon as he saw Eyal, he aimed his rifle and fired. Eyal dove aside just in time to avoid the bullet, which lodged itself in the tree behind him. At that moment, he understood that the goal of these men was not to capture, but to kill. Acting fast, he pulled a syringe from his pouch, and pushed his sleeve above the elbow. 'What are you doing?' the commander screamed. 'Stop!' Eyal ignored him. Before their scandalized eyes, he injected the brownish liquid into his arm before sending the syringe hurtling into the ravine nearby. If a bit of the costly substance remained in the syringe, it was now gone. Turning to the commander--on the assumption that the low-ranking soldiers had no idea why he'd been condemned to death--he said, 'The antidote you're seeking is now in one place, and one place only. Streaming through my blood. My blood is now worth millions. It would be a shame to murder me, no?' When Eyal Gilboa's mission in a foreign country takes a sinister twist, he finds himself completely on his own with no means of recruiting assistance from either the Mossad or CIA.

Scholars found his greatness between the covers of his many works; the masses of Baghdad flocked by the thousands to hear his sermons every Sabbath afternoon. Men, women, and children of all ages and backgrounds sat, stood, and pushed together enraptured, as he spun his web of law, homiletics, and parable, captivating all his listeners, each at his own level. He was as great a storyteller and author of parables as he was a scholar. In the tradition of such Torah giants as the Maggid of Dubno and the Chofetz Chaim, he had an uncanny knack for composing stories that were entertaining in themselves, but also taught eternal lessons. The children were amused and enthralled; the adults had food for a week's constructive thought. In this marvelously versatile book, Yaakov Kahn collects some of the finest parables of the Ben Ish Chai. Aptly, he calls it Golden Apples, following the wisdom of Solomon, who describes the truth within a parable as a golden apple, wreathed by the silver setting of the story that teaches it. Indeed, these stories are pure gold. For parents and teachers, adults and children, speakers and readers, this is a book that will amuse, interest, and instruct. It's the kind of book you will pick up over and over again. No wonder the original Hebrew edition is so popular--and so will this new translation be. This is the first time the eloquence and imagination of the Ben Ish Chai has been brought to English readers. It is long overdue--and sure to be very welcome""-- Back cover.",Jewish parables;Hasidim;Legends;Jewish legends,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,item

The only child of a family deeply rooted in Djerba, the legendary island of Kohanim, Shulamit Cohen was Sefardic, a miracle child whose Jewish education had taken place entirely at home. Yet within moments of her arrival she felt entirely at home in Gateshead - and Gatehead felt entirely at home with its new, unusual and exuberant student. It was that exuberance, coupled with her rock-solid emunah and her unparalleled love for Torah, which carried Shulamit through her many journeys and challenges. That wide-eyed student grew up to be the wife of an impoverished Torah scholar in Gateshead, a rabbanit in Marseilles when her husband was appointed av beis din, a widow who married off eight children, and, after her remarriage, the wife of one of the outstanding figures in Yerushalayim's Eida Chareidis. Quite a journey; and Shulamit was quite a personality. Bestselling author Libby Lazewnik brings her to vivid life: her unusual optimism in the face of daunting circumstances and her devotion to her family - a family that included all of Klal Yisrael. From Djerba to Jerusalem is an engrossing story. More: it's an eye-opening, heart-opening look at the power of chesed, emunah, and love. -- Back cover.","Jewish women;Tunisia;Rabbis' spouses;Hospitality;Judaism;Jewish ethics;Jewish religious education;Jewish way of life;Customs and practices;Orthodox Judaism;Rabbis;Houmt Souk (Tunisia);England;Gateshead (England);France;Marseille (France);Middle East;Jerusalem (Israel);Biography;History;Bitton-Blau, Shulamit",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,item

But for their children's welfare, the Bildmanns and Alexanders of Germany and the Elsigs of Austria had to take this fateful, heart-wrenching step. As war clouds gathered over Europe, these loving parents dispatched their sons, Erich, Karl, Otto and Kurt, to the relative safety of England, there to be housed among strangers. Soon, however, the ground beneath their feet begins to burn as their British haven becomes a target for Hitler's Luftwaffe bombers. Together with Miles Benjamin and Joshua King, their newfound English schoolmates, the four European boys are evacuated to the countryside and are taken in by kindhearted farming families. This pastoral setting, remote from the terrifying war that is raging all around, presents challenges of a different sort: How can these religious youngsters retain their ties to the faith imbued in them by their parents, without offending their non-Jewish hosts? How will they cope with the suspicions and hostility of gentile neighbors? And how will these teenagers, really little more than children, survive alone, so far from the place they called 'home'?"" -- Page [4] of cover.","World War II, 1939-1945;Children;England;Kindertransports (Rescue operations);Jewish refugees;Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945);Fiction;Historical fiction",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,item

I look at Tata. At his face waiting for promises, because he has nothing else to wait for. I think of these words, the most important ones he has ever said. I pull out my own three words. ""I - promise - you."" Maniusia's promise binds her to her faith, her spirit, and ultimately, her life. I Promise You is the painful yet transcendent, true story of Maniusia (Miriam) Adler, as told to her granddaughter, acclaimed author Yael Mermelstein. Through Maniusia's story, you will experience what it truly means to win the war.-Page [4] of cover.","Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945);Poland;Pabianice (Poland);Personal narratives;Jewish children in the Holocaust;Biography;Poetry;Adler, Maniusia (Miriam), 1928-",Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,item

Unbeknownst to him, though, these lenses were ground by a Jerusalem tzaddik, which makes them very atypical. To Leibel's shock and dismay, he suddenly finds, upon entering shul after his surgery, that he can now read the aveiros that everyone has done, inscribed right on their foreheads! And this is just the beginning... Having been handed a unique Heavenly assignment, Leibel has no choice but to embark on a spiritual journey that he never would have dreamed would be his to take. His holy mission brings him from quiet Toronto to bustling Yerushalayim, to the Kosel, to the lesser-known Little Kosel, and finally, to a third wall, the ""wall of fire."" But all along, Leibel is in great danger, for there is someone out there who desires nothing more than to destroy him... Like Gottesman's other books, Wall of Fire is soaked with yiras Shamayim, ahavas Yisrael, and love for Eretz Yisrael. The story spans lands and centuries, and is rich with many characters from Jewish history, like Elkanah and Chanah Haneviah, Eli Hakohen, King Achav, Rabbi Yehudah Halevi, the Baal Shem Tov, and Reb Uri of Strelisk. To read Wall of Fire is to enter a holy, mystical world, one that will set your neshamah on fire!

Can a valiant Jewish hero - who found himself unprepared for life in an ordinary world - be forgiven for the terrible mistakes he made as a father? Can a sensitive soul, who's been pummeled, disgraced, and failed by those nearest and dearest to him, muster up the fortitude to listen to the tiny, still voice calling out from within?

In other stories, the struggling owners of a small grocery store in the years of the Great Depression still manage to do kindness and gemillas chesed. Read about the amazing transformation of a girl called Milly;and then for anyone who has ever had a dream, yearning for it to come true, there is the story of Elisheva and a certain special coat.
